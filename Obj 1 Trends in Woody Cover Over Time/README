Mannkendall, Visualizing wooody trends in L3 Ecoregions: The purpose of this script is to examine changes in woody cover across L1 and L3 ecoregions of the Eastern Temperate Forests. There are two statistical tests, Modified Mann Kendall and Sen's Slope.The outputs are a series of jpgs depicting acf plots for each region, a table presenting the stats from the mmk and the sen's slope that was used in the manuscript, and a graph of percent woody cover over time. It also outputs a .xlsx file with the results of the mmk and sen's slope that is used in the script that makes a map of sen's slope across the Eastern Temperate Forests.
